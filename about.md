I'm a developer living in London. I work on iOS and OS X projects written in Objective-C, Swift, and C++. I also dabble in web technologies like Ruby on Rails.

You can find me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iotize) and [on GitHub](https://github.com/iotize).

I joined [Alcorn McBride](http://alcorn.com) in 2009 as the lead developer on their iOS products, first working on native iPhone and iPad apps, and later porting existing Windows products to OS X and iOS. I had the opportunity to work with new technologies such as iBeacons and Apple Watch.

In 2013, I interned with [Pocket App](https://pocketapp.co.uk) and had the opportunity to build several iPhone apps for different clients.

After that, I graduated from the [University of Surrey](http://surrey.ac.uk) with a BSc in Computing.

Here are a few projects I've helped build:

- ShowTouch iBeacon Support
- ShowWatcher
- FriendChain
- Holla@Me
- Argos iBeacon Demo
- VGAMR ?
