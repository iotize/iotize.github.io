# How to use keyboard shortcuts for moving lines up/down in Xcode

It's not a challenge to cut and paste or drag and drop a line of code to move it, but in the spirit of [constant, continuous improvement](https://lifehacker.com/get-better-at-getting-better-the-kaizen-productivity-p-1672205148), remembering this keyboard shortcut will save a few moments every day â€” and that adds up to a sizeable efficiency upgrade over the course of weeks, months, and years.

The shortcuts are:

* Use `cmd + alt + [` to move a line up.
* Use `cmd + alt + ]` to move a line down.

Assuming you're using a keyboard with a UK or US format, I find it easier to remember as:

* Hold both the keys to the left of the spacebar.
* Press `[` to go up, `]` to go down.
