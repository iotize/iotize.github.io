On a non-retina screen, points directly equate to pixels. On a retina screen in which there are exactly twice as many pixels, each point represents a 2×2 grid.</p><p>To give an example, a line of code that says 'draw a circle with a radius of 50pt' would, on a non-retina screen, render with a radius of 50 pixels. On a retina display, the system knows that each point is equivalent to 2×2 pixels, and so the circle would be rendered with a radius of 100 pixels. This looks the same to the user, but at a higher resolution.</p><p>Most on-screen components - navigation bars, tab bars, lines, and text - are drawn in points using Core Graphics and as such don't need modifying. In most cases, the only thing developers need to be concerned with are images: app icons, bar icons, photos, and video.</p><p>The reason images don't scale up is because the number of pixels rendered to the screen is limited to the number of pixels stored in the image data. This is fixed by supplying larger images that have more data.</p><p>At this point in time, the best practice is to provide 1x, 2x, and 3x sizes for each image asset, or vector-based images where possible.

</code></pre><p>In iOS and macOS projects, finding a resource by name is handy because it means making all resources known to the project , which – so long as the resource files are all within the project directory – means the same project can be compiled on another machine without requiring specific and seemingly unrelated directories or files in a separate area of the file system. It's all self-contained.</p><p>In an Xcode playground there's no obvious 'bundle' to draw from. There are no other files, no xcassets – it's just a window of code.</p><p>Fortunately, that doesn't mean images can't be referenced by name. Images must simply be added to a specific 'Resources' directory, which can be seen in the File Inspector of a playground:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2020/05/playground-image-bad-access.png"/><p>(Currently there's an error because there's no image at that location.)</p><p>This Resource Path points to a location within the playground, revealing that it's actually a bundle rather than a file:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2020/05/playground-bundle-contents.png"/><p>Inside are one or more .swift files, some playground specific files, and an empty Resources directory.</p><p>Adding an image to this directory makes it available to the playground:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2020/05/playground-bundle-with-image.png"/><p>That's it!

If one of those asynchronous methods calls another, it can require disambiguating the returned <code>Result</code> both in the intermediary layer and at the final call site:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">struct</span> RegistrationService {

                    <span class="call">completion</span>(.<span class="call">success</span>(user))

            }
        }
    }
}

<span class="keyword">let</span> service = <span class="type">RegistrationService</span>(marketingPreferencesService: <span class="type">MarketingPreferencesService</span>())

        <span class="call">print</span>(error)
    }
}
</code></pre><p>In this small example, there are only two switch statements for dealing with the <code>Result</code> type, but in a typical project there could be many types like these that all rely on each other, and that can quickly add up to a whole lot of <code>Result</code> wrangling.</p><p>The final call site would typically have unique behaviour and is harder to generalise. The intermediary calls, though, have a similar pattern. In this case, the call from <code>RegistrationService</code> to <code>marketingPreferencesService</code>:</p><ul><li>Calls the original completion with a different value if the request is successful.</li><li>Passes the error through to the original completion if the request fails.</li></ul><p>This logic can be extracted into a reusable function and used in each service that follows this pattern:</p><pre><code><span class="keyword">func</span> replaceSuccess&lt;Success, NewSuccess, Failure&gt;(with newSuccess: <span class="type">NewSuccess</span>, completion: <span class="keyword">@escaping</span> (<span class="type">Result</span>&lt;<span class="type">NewSuccess</span>, <span class="type">Failure</span>&gt;) -&gt; <span class="type">Void</span>) -&gt; (<span class="type">Result</span>&lt;<span class="type">Success</span>, <span class="type">Failure</span>&gt;) -&gt; <span class="type">Void</span> {
    { result <span class="keyword">in
        switch</span> result {
            <span class="keyword">case</span> .<span class="dotAccess">success</span>:
                <span class="call">completion</span>(.<span class="call">success</span>(newSuccess))
            <span class="keyword">case</span> .<span class="dotAccess">failure</span>(<span class="keyword">let</span> error):
                <span class="call">completion</span>(.<span class="call">failure</span>(error))
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>This function:</p><ol><li>Has two arguments: the first is the value to use for replacing in case of success, and the second is the completion we want to call with the new success or failure when this function is called.</li><li>Returns the same closure type as is expected for any completion callback: it takes a <code>Result</code> and returns <code>Void</code>.</li></ol><p>The switch statement in <code>RegistrationService</code> can be replaced with:</p><pre><code>marketingPreferencesService.<span class="call">subscribe</span>(email: email, completion: <span class="call">replaceSuccess</span>(with: user, completion: completion))
</code></pre><p>Any other types with a similar approach – in this case, ones that rely on a second asynchronous call for which the result should be ignored – can use the same function. This reduces the amount of code needed, which is a nice improvement, but more importantly it helps to make the approach consistent throughout the codebase.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://www.ryanjdavies.com/articles/snapshotting-and-blurring-views-ios-7</guid><title>Snapshotting and Blurring Views (iOS 7)</title><description></description><link>http://www.ryanjdavies.com/articles/snapshotting-and-blurring-views-ios-7</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Mar 2014 17:00:00 +0000</pubDate><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Apple use an overlaying blur effect throughout iOS 7 to suggest 'depth' to the user, seen in the notification center, control center, and in many of Apple's apps:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2014/03/embrace_translucency_2x2.png"/><p>But how are they achieving this effect? Some expected there to be a new <code>UIView</code> subclass that would automatically blur its background, but no such luck.</p><p>Instead, Apple introduced new, flexible methods on <code>UIView</code> that - along with some WWDC sample code - make it easy for developers to make use of blurring in their apps.</p><h2>Rendering UIKit Content</h2><p>When you apply a blur effect on an image in your image editor it works by performing a complex algorithm on each pixel and its surrounding pixels. iOS is no exception - in order to create a blur effect, we need to create a bitmap image from the view hierarchy we have on screen.</p><p><code>CALayer</code>, the workhorse for each view, has had the <code>-renderInContext:</code> method since iOS 2.0. It renders itself and all sublayers into a graphics context that can then have any effects applied to it before being converted into an image for display.</p><p>Unfortunately, as it runs in the CPU, <code>-renderInContext:</code> can be incredibly slow for complex hierarchies. It also doesn't take any view transforms into account.</p><p>Thankfully Apple introduced new methods on <code>UIView</code> in iOS 7 for creating snapshots of view hierarchies:</p><ul><li><code>snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates:</code> - the fastest method for creating still snapshots of a view hierarchy. Returns a <code>UIView</code> instance whose layer contents are immutable, which makes it useless for applying blur effects.</li><li><code>resizableSnapshotViewFromRect:afterScreenUpdates:withCapInsets:</code> - similar to <code>snapshotViewAfterScreenUpdates:</code> but with resizable insets.</li><li><code>drawViewHierarchyInRect:afterScreenUpdates:</code> - draws in the current image context, and according to WWDC 2013 Session 226 is up to 8 times faster than <code>renderInContext:</code>. This is the method we'll be using to apply image effects.</li></ul><p>Drawing a view hierarchy now looks like this:</p><pre><code><span class="type">UIGraphicsBeginImageContext</span>(rect.<span class="property">size</span>);
[view drawViewHierarchyInRect:rect afterScreenUpdates:<span class="type">NO</span>];
<span class="type">UIImage</span> *image = <span class="type">UIGraphicsGetImageFromCurrentImageContext</span>();
<span class="type">UIGraphicsEndImageContext</span>();
</code></pre><p>The <code>image</code> object can then be manipulated as needed.</p><h2>Applying the blur effect</h2><p>To achieve an identical blur effect we'll use Apple's sample code, which is available in the UIImageEffects WWDC 2013 sample project. If you have an Apple developer account, you can find it <a href="https://developer.apple.com/downloads/index.action?name=WWDC%202013">here</a>.</p><p>Once that's included in your project, you'll also need a view hierarchy to blur. I'm using a simple rainbow image to see a colourful blur:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2014/03/ios-simulator-screen-shot-22-mar-2014-20-30-31.png"/><p>Now you can import <code>UIImage+ImageEffects.h</code> and call <code>-applyLightEffect</code> on the <code>UIImage</code> you generated from the view hierarchy:</p><pre><code><span class="type">UIImage</span> *blurredImage = [image applyLightEffect];
</code></pre><p>That's it! All that's left is to render the image:</p><img src="http://www.ryanjdavies.com/assets/images/2014/03/ios-simulator-screen-shot-22-mar-2014-20-30-33.png"/><p>You can see Apple's engineers discuss snapshotting and the iOS 7 blur effect in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2013/">WWDC 2013 Session 226</a>. You can also read about Apple's stance on user interface depth in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
